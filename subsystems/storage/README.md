# Storage & Bandwidth

## Introduction

The system has a variety of static data assets 

* Content Directory: xx
* Membership: xx
* Proposals: xx
* Council: xxx



## Goals

Here are some highlighted goals 

* Distinct roles for storage and distributing data.
* Storage system with redundancy and only partial replication in nodes.
* Distribution system with flexible policy space, allowing for Content Delivery Network (CDN) like organisation.
* Storage providers incentivized by a mix of
  * payment for uploads (not in Giza)
  * probabilistic on-chain proof-of-storage challenges (not in Giza)
  * payment from peer providers & bandwidth providers during synching (not in Giza)
  * slashing by discretion from group lead, with subsequent loss of reputational capital of membership in this role.
  * working group payments
* Bandwidth providers incentives by a mix of
  * slashing by discretion from group lead, with subsequent loss of reputational capital of membership in this role.
  * payment from gateway providers (not in Giza)
  * working group payments
* On-chain host resolution metadata.
* Rich ownership model where members, channels, working groups and even the council as a whole can custody storage assets.
