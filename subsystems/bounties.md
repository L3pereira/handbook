# Bounties

## Introduction

The only other way to fund the production of goods that create benefits to a broad set of platform participants is through a financing proposal or discretionary spending by a working group lead out of the group budget. These processes incur the transaction costs of beneficiaries having to convince a number of external decision-makers, such as a council financing quorum, that this is a good idea. For smaller initiatives that ideally should start and finish sooner, or where they depend on knowledge or insight that is not as broadly shared, these processes become too costly.

## Assurance Contracts and Dominant Assurance Contracts

An assurance contract is a funding scheme which is intended to override the inherent free-riding problem in financing public goods by allowing contributors to enter into binding conditional commitments to provide resources to fund the good if a sufficient level of funding is commited. By setting the level sufficiently high, every public good beneficiary becomes close to pivotal to getting the good produced, which generates a rationale incentive to unilaterally commit. Dominant assurance contracts are such schemes where the funding has to be deployed towards a specific service provider or entrepreneur who will produce the good using the funding, and in exchange for this prividlige to possibly generate a profit from this activity, the entrepreneur has to put up an initial bounty, called a _cherry_ , which is split among all contributors pro-rata. This cherry generates an incentive for contributors, as even when the funding fails, they get a benefit.

## Roles

* **Creator:** A member who creates a given bounty.
* **Oracle:** The agent responsible for deciding the outcome of a bounty where entrants have submitted work. Is either a specific member, or the council as whole.
* **Contributor:** An agent  responsible for contributing funds that finance the bounty. Is either a specific member.
* **Worker:** A member who has announced their participation in producing deliverable in a given bounty.

## Concepts

### Funding Period Type

The funding period type refers to how funds are collected for the benefit of a bounty, and there are fundamentally two types:

* **Perpetual:** The funding has not preset termination date, and new contributors can join on an ongoing basis. There is however a _target_ which sets the upper bound for how much can be contributed.
* **Limited:** The funding lasts for no longer than a given number of blocks, called the _funding period_ . There is a lower bound for how much must be contributed
