# Forum

## Introduction

The forum is the primary place for community wide asynchronous written communication about all topics relevant to platform among members. It is hierarchically organised into a tree of categories, each with designated moderators responsible for policing and encouraging effective and benefictial interactions among members. The moderators are part of a designated forum working group, and the lead of that working group can decide what moderators are responsible for what categories. Categories contain subcategories, and threaded topic based discussions, called _threads_, where any member can open a thread, and others can come and make replies in the form of _posts_. Some threads can also include a poll, allowing any member to weight in on some question.
