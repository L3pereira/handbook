# Forum

## Introduction

The forum is the primary place for community-wide asynchronous written communication about all topics relevant to the platform among members. It is hierarchically organized into a tree of categories, each with designated moderators responsible for policing and encouraging effective and beneficial interactions among members. The moderators are part of a designated forum working group, and the lead of that working group can decide what moderators are responsible for what categories. Categories contain subcategories, and threaded topic-based discussions, called _threads_, where any member can open a thread, and others can come and make replies in the form of _posts_. Some threads can also include a poll, allowing any member to weight in on a question.

## Roles

* **Member:** Members participate as normal forum users, creating and responding to threads, participating in polls, and so on.
* **Moderator:** Moderators are assigned to subsets of categories... \(stickied???\) hierarchical or just plain????
  * LIST ACTIONS THEY CAN DO.. they cant add or remove moderators!!!!
* **Lead:** The forum lead is a member occupying the lead role in the forum working group. Beyond the normal working group lead obligations, this .. The lead can act as a moderator as well.
  * LIST ACTIONS THEY CAN DO

## Concepts

### Archiving

Both categories and threads can be _archived,_ and updating this is the responsibility of the moderators. Archiving should be understood as a read-only mode for normal usage of the given part of the forum.



archived: directly or not,  ACTIVE: not archived in either sense

* direct or indirect, cant:
  * cant create category
* can still:
  * everythnge else: udpate archival status of decedant
  * udpate title & description & stickied threads

Notice that a lot of the limits are forward-looking. In the even to of a runtime upgrade, it may be that the limits are changed in a more restrictive direction, in which case it should not be expected that there is a migration that throws out the storage state, instead, the limit should only be understood to have bearing on future actions.
