# Forum

## Introduction

The forum is the primary place for community wide asynchronous written communication about all topics relevant to platform among members. It is hierarchically organized into a tree of categories, each with designated moderators responsible for policing and encouraging effective and beneficial interactions among members. The moderators are part of a designated forum working group, and the lead of that working group can decide what moderators are responsible for what categories. Categories contain subcategories, and threaded topic based discussions, called _threads_, where any member can open a thread, and others can come and make replies in the form of _posts_. Some threads can also include a poll, allowing any member to weight in on some question.

## Roles

* **Member:** Members participate as normal forum users, creating and responding to threads, participating in polls, and so on.
* **Moderator:** Moderators are assigned to subsets of categories... \(stickied???\) hierarchical or just plain????

## Concepts

### Archiving

Notice that a lot of the limits are forward looking. In the even to of a runtime upgrade, it may be that the limits are changed in a more restrictive direction, in which case it should not be expected that there is a migration that throws out storage state, instead, the limit should only be understood to have bearing on future actions.
