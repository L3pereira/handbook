# Validation

Cover validation & nomination in this section.

## Keys for Validators

Roles such as the `Validator` require users to manage a selection of keys \(accounts\), where each key is dedicated to a specific purpose. While in our Acropolis testnet only three keys were required to be a Validator, in Rome, five are needed.

### `Stash Key`

The stash key is typically where a participant's wealth on the platform is stored. In most cases the stash key should only ever have to sign one message in order to assign the controller account. Once this is done, the controller account can act on behalf of the stash key.

### `Controller Key`

The controller key acts on behalf of the stash key. It can perform actions with the "weight" of the stash key behind it.

### `Session Key`

Session keys are specific to the validator role and have a variety of purposes linked to the activities of validators on the network. For Rome, two new session keys will be added.

You can read more about `validators` and their `session keys` in our handbook section dedicated to them.
