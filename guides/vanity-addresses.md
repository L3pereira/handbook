# Vanity Addresses

### Vanity Address Generation

Because Polkadot and Joystream testnet addresses are formatted in the same way, you can use the page [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts/vanity) to generate a vanity address for Joystream.

Alternatively, using the subkey utility mentioned above, you could simply do:

```text
subkey vanity <string>
```

The longer the string you would like to be part of your address, the longer the process will take.
