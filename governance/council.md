# Council

## Introduction

The council is a political organ 

* political
* fast- day to day: stand in reprsentation of the full set of stakeholders on a day to day basis.

## Actors

The relevant actors in the council system are

* **Candidate:** A member who has staked and stands as an alternative for council membership in an ongoing election cycle.
* **Council Member:** A member who has stood as a candidate in an election and won a place in a council. Has the primary responsibility to participate in voting on and deliberating around proposals in the proposal system.

### Election

An election is the periodic process by which a new council is selected by voters among candidates running for a seat on the next council. Elections occur periodically, and each one has a sequence of stages referred to as the election cycle. An election will begin while the current council is active, and the sitting council is only relieved once a new one has been successfully elected. As will become clear, this process can go on for a unknown amount of time.

* **Election:** During this stage, not only does the council operate, but there is an election ongoing.
