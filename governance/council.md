## Roles

### **Council**

The council has a fixed number of seats `NUMBER_OF_COUNCIL_SEATS` occupied by members. The seats are always occupied, allowing the platform to dispose of all proposals they may come in at any time. The council body has two high level states described as follows.

* **Election:** During this stage, not only does the council operate, but there is an election ongoing.

As will become clear, this process can go on for a unknown amount of time.
